                "description": "Research tells us that the way to get people to change is not to start with trying to change their attitudes alone, but to start with the behaviors associated with the attitudes. When people see themselves behaving differently, they can then think of themselves differently and the attitude change will follow. The six behaviors discussed that you could start today are derived from over 90 interviews with female executives in sports. \n\nEmily Jaenson’s motto is “Be so good they won’t forget you!” and this motto has carried her through her career to land her former role as General Manager of the Triple-A Reno Aces.  Upon accepting this role in 2018, Jaenson became the first female in Triple-A to hold the GM role in nearly 20 years. Jaenson leads a podcast, Leadership is Female, where she interviews executives in sport so that she and her guests can guide the next generation of female leadership forward and leads a team of sports front office veterans in their consulting business.

                "description": "NBC News journalist Mariana Atencio has traveled the world from Haiti to Hong Kong. In her TEDx talk, Mariana tells us how the people she's met along the way and her own immigrant experience have taught her that the only thing we all have in common is being human. Get ready to 'get human' and embrace what makes you different! Take a stand to defend your race: the human race!\n\nMariana Atencio is a Peabody Award-winning journalist, currently a national correspondent for NBC News and MSNBC. The Huffington Post called her ‘our Latina Christiane Amanpour’ and Jorge Ramos wrote: ‘Mariana is the next-gen voice for Latinos breaking all barriers.’ Mariana is known for combining in-studio work and high profile interviews like Pope Francis, with tenacious field reporting all over the world, covering youth-led protests in places like Ferguson, Mexico, Haiti and Hong Kong.\r\n\r\n\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

                "description": "There are about 7,000 languages spoken around the world -- and they all have different sounds, vocabularies and structures. But do they shape the way we think? Cognitive scientist Lera Boroditsky shares examples of language -- from an Aboriginal community in Australia that uses cardinal directions instead of left and right to the multiple words for blue in Russian -- that suggest the answer is a resounding yes. \"The beauty of linguistic diversity is that it reveals to us just how ingenious and how flexible the human mind is,\" Boroditsky says. \"Human minds have invented not one cognitive universe, but 7,000.\"\n\nCheck out more TED Talks: http://www.ted.com\n\nThe TED Talks channel features the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes (or less).
